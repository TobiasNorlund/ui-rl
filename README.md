`ui-rl` is a **library for fine-tuning Computer Use agent models**.
It provides utilities for scalable training on verifiable UI tasks to improve model reliability on targeted domains and tasks.
This allows you to focus more on building verifiable tasks and optimizing model performance, and less on boilerplate code such as agent loops, rollout generations, torch data loading etc.

`ui-rl` currently supports [UITARS 1.5 7B](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-1.5-7B), with more models coming. 


## Installation

pip install ui-rl
